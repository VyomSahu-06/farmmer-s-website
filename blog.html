                <h4>Organic Tomatoes</h4>
                <p>Tomatoes are technically fruits, specifically berries, despite being treated as vegetables in culinary contexts. They are rich in essential nutrients like vitamins C and K, potassium, and folate, and contain lycopene, an antioxidant linked to heart health and cancer prevention. Originating in western South America, tomatoes were first domesticated by the Aztecs and Incas before spreading to Europe in the 16th century. They come in various colors, including red, yellow, orange, green, and purple, each with unique flavors and nutrient profiles. China is the world's leading tomato producer, followed by India and the United States. Interestingly, tomatoes continue to ripen after being picked due to ethylene gas, making them a climacteric fruit. They thrive in warm climates, ideally around 70–85°F (20–30°C), and are sensitive to cold. Once thought to be poisonous in Europe due to their relation to nightshade plants, tomatoes are now recognized as one of the most popular crops globally, essential in diverse cuisines from Italian to Mexican and Indian. The largest tomato on record weighed over 10 pounds, showcasing the potential for remarkable growth. Their versatility and health benefits solidify tomatoes' status as a staple ingredient worldwide.</p>

                <p>Musk melon, also known as cantaloupe or muskmelon, is a nutrient-rich fruit belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is primarily grown in warm climates, thriving in temperatures between 70°F and 90°F (21°C to 32°C).
